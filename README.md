# This Project Is No Longer Being Updated

Breakouts is in "archival" mode. The website and repo will remain available, but no updates will be made. We will not accept any new pull requests or contributions at this point.

Thanks for all the help from everyone! If anyone wants to take over the project, please email me at matt.e.greer@gmail.com

## Helping You Select a JavaScript Game Engine

**tl;dr** Breakouts is to JavaScript game engines what [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) is to JavaScript MV\* frameworks.

There are a lot of JavaScript game engines out there, the JavaScript wiki lists [over 80 of them](https://github.com/bebraw/jswiki/wiki/Game-Engines). This project is an attempt to get some insight into the engines out there. This was done by implementing a simple version of the game Breakout in various engines. With the implementations in hand, you can compare and contrast and play with the engines to help get a feel for whether you like them or not.

### Companion Article
There is also a companion article to this project on [BuildNewGames](http://buildnewgames.com/game-engine-comparison/), which goes into detail on the first
three engines that were a part of Breakouts (Impact, Lime and Crafty).
