# Breakouts -- Quintus

http://www.html5quintus.com

##Status

Slightly Quick n' Dirty implementation using Quintus, but pretty feature complete.

Notes:
* Show's off the container support by scaling in the Bricks on each level
* Has Mobile support, but without sound
* Not yet tested on IE
* Did not implement Tile support
