BATCH FILES
Originally produced by Thomas Rutter, now with minor amendments by BJ.

You can drag and drop your 24-bit PNGs onto these batch files as an easy way
to process them without messing around with the command line. Dithered and
non-dithered optimised copies of the source PNGs will be created in the same
directory as the originals. The batch files must remain in the same directory
as pngquant.exe.
