#Breakouts -- CraftyJS

http://www.craftyjs.com

This implementation is using CraftyJS and is DOM based. As of this writing it's not done, but pretty close.
  
## Canvas version?
So far I am undecided whether to add a separate canvas version using CraftyJS in canvas mode, or make this one togglable
between the two. Most likely going to go with a separate implementation to keep things simple
