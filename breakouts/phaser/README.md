PhaserBreakout
==============

Breakout game implemented trought Phaser

I made it specially for this project: http://city41.github.io/breakouts/
 
You can play it here:

I've made some gameplay changes compared to the other engine ports/versions and they are more like bonus features.
 
If you press: "B" you will toggle mouse/keyboard control
If you press: "S" you will toggle a "shake" effect
If you press: "V" you will spawn a ball (there is no collision check till the countdown
ends so don't freak out if the ball pop out of the game bounds.
 
Other things it that you can save a ball if hit it with the vertical side of the paddle but only if it hit the top half - I call it "action save" or "phew just in time save" :P
Also when multiple balls are in game they collide with each other.

This game is build with:

Phaser 1.1.3
Phaser is a fast, free and fun open source game framework for making desktop and mobile browser HTML5 games. It uses Pixi.js internally for fast 2D Canvas and WebGL rendering.
