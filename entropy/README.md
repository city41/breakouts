##Breakout game build with Entropy entity system framework##

###How to run###
The game loads stuff using XHR and it needs HTTP server to run. You can grab one from npm:
```
npm install -g http-server
```
Then navigate to game directory and run the server:
```
http-server
```
Now, navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (if standard port was used) and play the game.
